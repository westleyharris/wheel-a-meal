To use real restaurant data, you'll need a Google Places API key:

2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - **Places API**
   - **Geocoding API**
4. Create credentials (API Key) from the Credentials page
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## How to Use

1. Enter your zipcode in the input field
2. Click "Find Restaurants" to fetch nearby options
3. Click "Spin the Wheel!" to randomly select a restaurant
4. View the selected restaurant's name, address, and rating

## Fallback Mode

If the Google Places API is not configured or fails, the app will automatically use mock restaurant data and display a warning message.
